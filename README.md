# Rubik's Cube
This application is a virtual Rubik's Cube implemented in JavaScript using Three.js to handle 3D Rendering.

This project began in 2019 during my junior year of college, and is still ongoing.

To view it running, visit https://keatonmueller.github.io/#/cube.

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

# Controls
The controls currently support clockwise and counterclockwise face and slice rotations. A lowercase keystroke indicates a clockwise turn of the corresponding face or slice, and a capital keystroke indicates a counterclockwise rotation.

You can learn more about traditional Rubik's Cube notation here: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/

Below are the keystrokes and their corresponding rotations:

`r` = R and `R` = R'

`l` = L and `L` = L'

`u` = U and `U` = U'

`d` = D and `D` = D'

`f` = F and `F` = F'

`b` = B and `B` = B'

`m` = M and `M` = M'

`e` = E and `E` = E'

`s` = S and `S` = S'
