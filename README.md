# Rubik's Cube
This application is a virtual Rubik's Cube implemented in JavaScript using Three.js to handle 3D Rendering.

This project began in 2019 during my junior year of college, and is still ongoing.

`r` rotates the Right face

`l` rotates the Left face

`u` rotates the Up face

`d` rotates the Down face
